I was born on March 23, 1987, in Caxinas, Vila do Conde, a place shaped by the sea and fishing traditions. From an early age, I was drawn to technology and problem-solving, which naturally led me to study Computer Engineering at FEUP. I earned my master’s degree in 2010, and though I later pursued a PhD, I chose to step away. It wasn’t the right time. I believe in doing things with purpose, in dedicating myself fully to projects that truly matter.  

My career has been a journey of building, optimizing, and modernizing digital systems. From 2010 to 2023, I worked in R&D at INESC TEC, focusing on information systems, web applications, GIS, and mobile computing. Along the way, I published research, presented at conferences, and collaborated on cutting-edge projects.  

Between 2013 and 2024, at 3Maps, I led the development and modernization of web systems for municipalities, regional governments, and ports, ensuring these infrastructures became more efficient, scalable, and future-proof.  

Today, I'm working on projects at APDL, where we’re transforming port management through smarter digital solutions. My work is a balance between software development and project management, always with a clear goal: simplifying complexity and delivering results. Whether optimizing geospatial data, improving real-time tracking, or integrating systems, I focus on building solutions that are both innovative and practical. Technology should empower, not complicate.  

Beyond work, I see myself as a multidisciplinary and proactive person, always looking for ways to grow and create. If I’m not immersed in a project, I’m probably reading, writing, or enjoying the sea breeze on a walk by the shore.
